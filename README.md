I wanted to see if I could independently, without being a part of the network, discover active Bitcoin nodes that are running worldwide.  This is being partially accomplished by a combination of a tool called MassScan (masscan) and some custom code (represented here) to send "version" packets to believed Bitcoin nodes to entice a response (verack) and verify.

So it turns out there's a pretty good (and by that I mean working perfectly for me) Python 3.x library to do bitcoin node connections and other functions like actually mining blocks over at https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib.  I still wanna continue the work I was doing for my own experience but for now there's a file that utilizes the library to find nodes.  Seems to work perfectly with known node addresses, so we'll have to see how it stacks up against possible nodes that I'm working with.
